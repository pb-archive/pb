pb001,UNRHYMED SONNET,,,Peter Birchall,Diana Birchall,,"Note: This is a word-illustration which succeeded to the dignity of a poem.
Countermount: Adv. Uphill, upwards, against a hill or slope; against the natural
course or ordinary way. And fig.
Adage: Such sayings as the conventional use to regulate their lives; those proverbs
which, if believed implicity, result in narrowness of mind.
Anfractuous: Winding; full of windings and turnings; tortuous.
Pismire: An ant.
Cairn: originally, a pyramid of rough stones, raised for a memorial or mark of
some kind; as a memorial of some event, or a sepulchral monument; b, as a
boundary mark, a landmark on a mountain top, or a trail marker.",,sonnet,,,,,,,Text,application/pdf,eng,pdf,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HUhS_43gRAUz1NnxP_xJAQwBm40UqBlZnsbso2Z0D20/edit?usp=sharing,,,,
pb002,MAKE DANGER,,,Peter Birchall,Diana Birchall,,"Make danger = attempt. Makar: a poet. Bellerophon: The Greek hero who rode Pegasus, the winged horse;hated by the gods, he ended his days an outcast. Hippocrene, a spring on mount Helicon, sacred to the Muses, made by Pegasus' hoof. Syrinx: Pan's pipe.   Thirling: thrilling, piercing. Dodona: one of the most sacred sites in ancient Greece; the  priests interpreted the rustling of the ramage (boughs, and the leaves on the boughs), and made prophesies. ram\age are ev'n\ = an anapest. Zephyrus: the west wind. Corybantes: the female devotees of the mother Goddess, Cybele; their orgiastic rites celebrated the self-castration and murder of Atys.
Dear Abby: the above is a word illustration which turned into a poem. While unfinished, I thought I would send it to you because of the classical references. I am sorry for being so dilatory with the magazine, but I have been very depressed (though cheered by smoking opium!): being a junkie is a mixed-blessing! As soon as I finish my work on X, I shall write a satire on Clinton which would make Juvenal blush! Your friend,
P.S.I cannibalized the first half of my filthiest epigram, Contrast, for this poem:
It is the poet highlights the roscid bush,
Adds silver to the warble of the thrush;Transforms the everyday, refines, adorns:
Paints Nature with a unicorn's-hair brush...

pb003,THE ANTIQUARY POET,,,Peter Birchall,Diana Birchall,,"Note: I hesitated to use the word Antiquarian in the title of this epigram because it calls to mind Donne's great epigram, and makes mine seem wordy and silly.

pb004,SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS,,,Peter Birchall,Diana Birchall,Diana Birchall,"To the Onlie Begetter:
   This sonnet stands up very well after almost forty years: I can't make up my mind whether to put a dash after ""yet""; to break up three lines with the same pause:— Of one who prays, and yet — cannot believe."" This is the way the breaks are now:—
Sleep is no balm        |  to soothe the troubled mind
Of one who prays        |  and yet cannot believe
That in life's search   |  there is something to find.
The 4|6 line was the most popular in Elizabethan poetry ( I believe Puttenham touts it);
I always try to have the same caesura(internal pause) only twice in succession, unless I
want ot make a stylistic point (not the case here).  If pauses are not skillfully varied even brilliant lines begin to sound monotonous. If anything, 4 stress lines must be more skillfully tuned than pentameters;— a long series of lines with a 4|4 break can be maddening.  Marmot Giganticus is an example of a very cleverly arranged variation of pauses. See attached  sheet.                            
P.S. Sorry for being such a mope.   ",,,,,,,,,Text,application/pdf,eng,pdf,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BZ98sITxt28p3kM4lH8-0EorPcJawvtk90ZIklovvA8/edit?usp=sharing,,,,

pb016,PAST BROWNING,,,Peter Birchall,Diana Birchall,,"meet your gaze
 
Pye-dog: an ownerless dog, a pariah. Borrowing from the Indians of the subcontinent in a poem about American autochthones. Crosses: on the way to Browning from the mountains, the road is dotted with white crosses — the memorials of those who died in car accidents. One cluster had six crosses, followed fifty yards further on by two more crosses! If one wanted to make an anti-drinking propoganda film, an Indian reservation would be the place to start!  The Governments treatment of the Indians was — and is a national disgrace! Instead of helping the Indians to help themselves, we give them general assistance — and signs in the supermarket which read: HOME TOWN PROUD: Living, Loving, Caring, Sharing ( the o of proud is a red heart); and LOVING. I am astonished that there are not more Indian axe-murderers!
 
Dear Curly Bear,
   This is to thank you for your talk at the Snow Goose Motel on Monday, August 7: after a week of listening to humorless rangers drone on about sedimentary rock and the dangers of feeding squirrels, it was a pleasure to listen to someone with a sense of fun. Who post signs
and iterate lists of things not to do, surely, these are at war with Nature — and themselves!    It is a great pity that the rangers are not Indians: what better stewards of the land than those whose ancestors lived in harmony with their enviornment for millenia!  
                                                                                                                Respectfully yours,
P. S.If you know of any book of Blackfoot poetry (transliterated Blackfoot on one page, English on the facing
page) that you think is well translated, I would be greatly obliged if you sent me the title.
Ascians: those who live on or near the equator, and on the summer solstice cast no shadow.
Calumet: the Indian peace-pipe.
Iniskim: The buffalo stone, a fossil-stone which attracts the buffalo. In the version of the Iniskim-stone legend which I read (Grinnel), the woman who find's the stone is a young brave's wife; today, I prefer her to be an old woman; tomorrow, I will have her young.
Piskun: the butte over which the buffalo were stampeded to their death by Indian youth's — one, in the lead, wearing a young buffalo's skin to attract them; the other, in the rear, wearing a wolf's skin to frighten them.
Stones: the Indians piled up stone mounds, tracks for the buffalo to run between.
